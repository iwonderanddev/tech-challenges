# IWD frontend challenge

## Setup

To avoid losing time, you will use a simple create-react-app bootstrap.

```bash
cd fullstack/senior
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
# or use yarn create react-app frontend --template typescript
cd frontend
yarn start
# This will open your browser to http://localhost:3000
```

## Guidelines

We want to see your skills to design business code to produce **efficient** and **maintainable** code over time.

DO

- Do use good design
- Follow reactjs best pratices: use hooks, functionnal components...
- Do maintainable design
- Do use unit tests
- Do use dependency management
- Do use consistent code styles
- Do use others dependencies if you want/need

> Some candidates had some issues with momentjs and create-react-app, avoid it

DON'T DO

- Do not loose time with build process, just use create-react-app `yarn start`
- Do not use Docker, Vagrant... we must be able to run the app only with `yarn start`
- Do not loose time with amazing CSS, be basic

## Domain

The app is supposed to display a list of surveys and the aggregated answers to
those. A survey is composed of a name and a code. For a given survey, aggregated
answers are available. There are 3 types of questions:

- QCM (multiple choice question)
- Numeric
- Date

For each type of question, the aggregated answers have a different format:

- QCM: the aggregated answers give the number of response for each available
  QCM answer.
- Numeric: the aggregated answers give the average of all answers
- Date: the aggregated answers give the list of dates of all answers

## Fake API

To simulate a REST like API, you copied the `api` folder into the
`frontend/public/` directory so that the following resources should be
available:

- `http://localhost:3000/api/list.json` replies with the list of available
  surveys
- `http://localhost:3000/api/{code}.json` replies with the aggregated data
  for the survey with the given code. For instance, `http://localhost:3000/api/XX2.json`
  gives the aggregated answers for the survey with the code `XX2`.

## The Test

### Stage 1

Show a list of the surveys coming from the list endpoint.

Result will be a simple list:

| Name     | Code |
| -------- | ---- |
| Paris    | XX1  |
| Chartres | XX2  |
| Melun    | XX3  |

### Stage 2

The user can now click on a survey item. It will show the aggregate data of this survey.

You can display the data the way you want, be creative (data visualization).

### Stage 3 (bonus)

> This is not mandatory, add this feature if you feel like it.

Add a search input on the survey list to filter surveys by names and/or code.
