# IWD junior _fullstack_ challenge frontend part

## Setup

To avoid losing time, you will use a simple create-react-app bootstrap.

```bash
cd fullstack/junior
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
# or use yarn create react-app frontend --template typescript
cd frontend
yarn start
# This will open your browser to http://localhost:3000
```

> Some candidates had some issues with momentjs and create-react-app, avoid it

DON'T DO

- Do not loose time with build process, just use create-react-app `yarn start`
- Do not use Docker, Vagrant... we must be able to run the app only with `yarn start`

## The Test

> For the backend data endpoints, use `http://localhost:8080` in your frontend code

Show a list of the surveys coming from the endpoint you have done in backend test

Result will be a simple list:

| Name     | Code |
| -------- | ---- |
| Paris    | XX1  |
| Chartres | XX2  |
| Melun    | XX3  |
